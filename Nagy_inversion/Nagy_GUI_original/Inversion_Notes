How to create an bathymetry inversion software:

Workflow:
Gravity data 
    --> Gravity grid (interpolate and grid)
		--> Density model (let the density of individual crustal (moho to magnetic basement top) columns change to match the gravity grid, constrained by layers with set densities and geometries:ice, water, sediment, mantle)
			--> Low-pass filtered density grid (experiment with this to find best filtering method)
				--> Bathymetry model (let the bathymetry grid under the ice shelf change shape to match the filtered density) 

Inputs:
gravity grid
ice surface grid -> bedmap2 surface
water surface grid -> open ocean: ???, under ice shelf: ROSETTA ice base radar
earth surface grid -> inland of grounding line: Bedmap2, open ocean: IBSCO, under ice shelf: RIGGS, various seismic studies
moho grid -> various moho models
