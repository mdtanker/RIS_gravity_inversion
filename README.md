# RIS_gravity_inversion
Here we use gravity data from Antarctica's Ross Ice Shelf region, mainly airborne data from the ROSETTA-Ice project, to perform a gravity inverison to model the sub ice shelf bathymetry. 

## Gravity Inversion Software 

### Geosoft Oasis Montaj 
* 3D 
* Square grid network 

### MiraGeoscience 
* 3D
* offer Vertical Prisms inversion

### Fatiando a Terra / Harmonica 

### SimPEG 
* 3D
* mesh based, not well suited (yet) for vertical prism inversion

### PyGIMLI 
* 3D
* mesh based

### GNS Woodward Fortran Code 
* 3D 
* Triangular grid network 
* Irregular grid spacing 
* Accepts constraint cells 

### GNS Nagy / Woodward Python Code 
* 3D 
* Same optimization of GNS fortran code 
* Square grid network 
* different grid spacing for each layer 

### Growth 3.0 Fortran Code
* 3D
* accepts seeds
*
