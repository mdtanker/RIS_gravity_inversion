The criteria we propose include (1) define-by-run API that allows users to construct the parameter search space dynamically, (2) efficient implementation of both searching and pruning strategies, and (3) easy-to-setup, versatile architecture that can be deployed for various purposes, ranging from scalable distributed computing to light-weight experiment conducted via interactive interface. In order to prove our point, we will introduce Optuna, an optimization software which is a culmination of our effort in the development of a next generation optimization software. As an optimization software designed with define-by-run principle, Optuna is particularly the first of its kind. We will present the design-techniques that became necessary in the development of the software that meets the above criteria, and demonstrate the power of our new design through experimental results and real world applications.

  abstract = {Ocean-ice interactions have exerted primary control on the Antarctic Ice Sheet and parts of the Greenland Ice Sheet, and will continue to do so in the near future, especially through melting of ice shelves and calving cliffs. Retreat in response to increasing marine melting typically exhibits threshold behavior, with little change for forcing below the threshold but a rapid, possibly delayed shift to a reduced state once the threshold is exceeded. For Thwaites Glacier, West Antarctica, the threshold may already have been exceeded, although rapid change may be delayed by centuries, and the reduced state will likely involve loss of most of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, causing {$>$}3 m of sea-level rise. Because of shortcomings in physical understanding and available data, uncertainty persists about this threshold and the subsequent rate of change. Although sea-level histories and physical understanding allow the possibility that ice-sheet response could be quite fast, no strong constraints are yet available on the worst-case scenario. Recent work also suggests that the Greenland and East Antarctic Ice Sheets share some of the same vulnerabilities to shrinkage from marine influence.},

  abstract = {Marine-terminating glaciers dominate the evolution of the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) and its contribution to sea-level rise. Widespread glacier acceleration has been linked to the warming of ocean waters around the periphery of Greenland but a lack of information on the bathymetry of the continental shelf and glacial fjords has limited our ability to understand how subsurface, warm, salty ocean waters of Atlantic origin (AW) reach the glaciers and melt them from below. Here, we employ high-resolution, airborne gravity data (AIRGrav) in combination with multibeam echo sounding (MBES) data, to infer the bathymetry of the coastal areas of Northwest Greenland for NASA's Ocean Melting Greenland (OMG) mission. High-resolution, AIRGrav data acquired on a 2 km spacing, 150 m ground clearance, with 1.5 mGal crossover error, is inverted in three dimensions to map the bathymetry. To constrain the inversion away from MBES data, we compare two methods: one based on the Direct Current (DC) shift of the gravity field (absolute minus observed gravity) and another based on the density of the bedrock. We evaluate and compare the two methods in areas with complete MBES coverage. We find the lowest standard error in bed elevation ({\textpm}60 m) using the DC shift method. When applied to the entire coast of Northwest Greenland, the three-dimensional inversion reveals a complex network of connected sea bed channels, not known previously, that provide natural and varied pathways for AW to reach the glaciers across the continental shelf. The study demonstrates that the gravity approach offers an efficient and practical alternative to extensive ship mapping in ice-filled waters to obtain information critical to understanding and modeling ice-ocean interaction along ice sheet margins.},

Interpreting the evolution of glacier fronts requires information about their depth below sea level and ocean thermal forcing, which are incompletely known in the region. Here, we combine airborne gravity and multibeam echo sounding data from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Oceans Melting Greenland (OMG) mission with ocean probe and fishing boat depth data to reconstruct the bathymetry extending from the glacier margins to the edges of the continental shelf. We perform a three-dimensional inversion of the gravity data over water and merge the solution with a mass conservation reconstruction of bed topography over land. In contrast with other parts of Greenland, we find few deep troughs connecting the glaciers to the sources of warm Atlantic Water, amidst a relatively uniform, shallow (350 m) continental shelf. The deep channels include the Kangerlugssuaq, Sermilik, Gyldenl{\o}ve, and Tingmiarmiut Troughs.},

  abstract = {We demonstrate the potential of gravity data to detect and to locate in-depth subtle normal faults in the basement relief of a sedimentary basin. This demonstration is accomplished by inverting the gravity data with the constraint that the estimated basement relief presents local abrupt faults and is smooth elsewhere. We inverted the gravity data from the onshore Almada Basin in northeastern Brazil, and we mapped several normal faults whose locations and plane geometries were already known from seismic imaging. The inversion method delineated well both the discontinuities with small or large slips and a sequence of step faults. Using synthetic data, we performed a systematic search of normal fault slips versus fault displacement depths to map the fault-detectable region in this space. This mapping helps to assess the ability of gravity inversion to detect normal faults. Mapping shows that normal faults with small ͑Ͻ0.5 km͒, medium ͑about 1 km͒, and large ͑about 2 km͒ vertical slips can be detected if the maximum midpoint depths of the fault planes are smaller than 1.8, 3.8, and 6.8 km, respectively.},

In particular, the gravity satellite missions of the last two decades have provided data in this remote region of the Earth and have allowed the investigation of the crust properties. Meanwhile, other important contributions in this direction has been given by the fourth International Polar Year (IPY, 2007--2008) which started seismographic and geodetic networks of unprecedented duration and scale, including airborne gravimetry over largely unexplored Antarctic frontiers. In this study, a new model for the Antarctica Moho depths is proposed. This new estimation is based on no satellite gravity measures, thanks to the availability of the gravity database ANTGG2015, that collects gravity data from ground-base, airborne and shipborne campaigns. In this new estimate of the Moho depths the contribution of the gravity measures has been maximized reducing any correction of the gravity measures and avoiding constraints of the solution to seismological observations and to geological evidence. With this approach a pure gravimetric solution has been determined. The model obtained is pretty in agreement with other Moho models and thanks to the use of independent data it can be exploited also for cross-validating different Moho depths solutions.},

  abstract = {Seismic reflection soundings of ice thickness and seabed depth were acquired on the Larsen C Ice Shelf in order to test a sub-ice shelf bathymetry model derived from the inversion of IceBridge gravity data. A series of lines was collected, from the Churchill Peninsula in the north to the Joerg Peninsula in the south, and also towards the ice front. Sites were selected using the bathymetry model derived from the inversion of free-air gravity data to indicate key regions where sub-ice shelf oceanic circulation may be affected by ice draft and seabed depth. The seismic velocity profiles in the upper 100 m of firn and ice was derived from shallow refraction surveys at a number of locations. Measured temperatures within the ice column and at the ice base were used to define the velocity profiles through the remainder of the ice column. Seismic velocities in the water column were derived from previous in situ measurements. Uncertainties in ice and water cavity thickness are in general {$<$}10 m. Compared with the seismic measurements, the rootmean-square error in the gravimetrically derived bathymetry at the seismic sites is 162 m. The seismic profiles prove the non-existence of several bathymetric features that are indicated in the gravity inversion model, significantly modifying the expected oceanic circulation beneath the ice shelf. Similar features have previously been shown to be highly significant in affecting basal melt rates predicted by ocean models. The discrepancies between the gravity inversion results and the seismic bathymetry are attributed to the assumption of uniform geology inherent in the gravity inversion process and also the sparsity of IceBridge flight lines. Results indicate that care must be taken when using bathymetry models derived by the inversion of free-air gravity anomalies. The bathymetry results presented here will be used to improve existing sub-ice shelf ocean circulation models.},

However, multiple cavity openings and complex geography mean that knowledge of bathymetry beneath the GIS is required to understand ice/ocean interactions. We invert NASA airborne gravity data to obtain bathymetry beneath the ice shelf. Our gravity/geology-constrained bathymetry is a significant advance on Bedmap2 bathymetry. The sub-ice shelf bathymetry consists of three cavities separated by topographic ridges extending from the ice shelf front to the grounding line. Passages allowing limited circulation of shallow ({$\lessequivlnt$}400 meters below sea level [mbsl]) water between cavities are present, but deeper water is confined to individual cavities. Within each cavity, bathymetric troughs ({$>$}900 mbsl) extend from the ice shelf front to subglacial valleys beneath the ice sheet. Our analysis of the gravity data also allows us to infer the presence of thick ({$>$}500 m) sediments near the grounding line through much of the GIS, as well as variations in the density and/or thickness of the crust underlying the ice shelf. Plain Language Summary Floating ice shelves surrounding Antarctica slow the flow of the Antarctic Ice Sheet toward the ocean. West Antarctic ice shelves, including the large Getz Ice Shelf, have thinned significantly over the past 20 years, due in part to increased flow of warming ocean water into the ocean cavities beneath them. This thinning results in acceleration of ice flowing into the ocean, so that more ice goes afloat, raising sea level. We mapped the shape of the ocean floor beneath the Getz Ice Shelf, which controls water circulation under the ice shelf. We found the ice shelf has three separate portions each with deep troughs that provide pathways for warm water to the edge of the ice sheet.},

Geophysical inverse problems are inherently multidisciplinary, requiring elements from the relevant physics, numerical simulation, and optimization, as well as knowledge of the geologic setting, and a comprehension of the interplay between all of these elements. The development and advancement of inversion methodologies can be enabled by a framework that supports experimentation, is flexible and extensible, and allows the knowledge generated to be captured and shared. The goal of this paper is to propose a framework that supports many different types of geophysical forward simulations and deterministic inverse problems. Additionally, we provide an open source implementation of this framework in Python called SIMPEG (Simulation and Parameter Estimation in Geophysics, http://simpeg.xyz). Included in SIMPEG are staggered grid, mimetic finite volume discretizations on a number of structured and semi-structured meshes, convex optimization programs, inversion routines, model parameterizations, useful utility codes, and interfaces to standard numerical solver packages. The framework and implementation are modular, allowing the user to explore, experiment with, and iterate over a variety of approaches to the inverse problem. SIMPEG provides an extensible, documented, and well-tested framework for inverting many types of geophysical data and thereby helping to answer questions in geoscience applications. Throughout the paper we use a generic direct current resistivity problem to illustrate the framework and functionality of SIMPEG.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The Southern Ocean surrounding Antarctica is a region that is key to a range of climatic and oceanographic processes with worldwide effects, and is characterised by high biological productivity and biodiversity. Since 2013, the International Bathymetric Chart of the Southern Ocean (IBCSO) has represented the most comprehensive compilation of bathymetry for the Southern Ocean south of 60{$^\circ$}S. Recently, the IBCSO Project has combined its efforts with the Nippon Foundation -- GEBCO Seabed 2030 Project supporting the goal of mapping the world's oceans by 2030. New datasets initiated a second version of IBCSO (IBCSO v2). This version extends to 50{$^\circ$}S (covering approximately 2.4 times the area of seafloor of the previous version) including the gateways of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and the Antarctic circumpolar frontal systems. Due to increased (multibeam) data coverage, IBCSO v2 significantly improves the overall representation of the Southern Ocean seafloor and resolves many submarine landforms in more detail. This makes IBCSO v2 the most authoritative seafloor map of the area south of 50{$^\circ$}S.},

  abstract = {Antarctica's ice shelves play a key role in stabilizing the ice streams that feed them. Since basal melting largely depends on ice-ocean interactions, it is vital to attain consistent bathymetry models to estimate water and heat exchange beneath ice shelves. We have constructed bathymetry models beneath the ice shelves of western Dronning Maud Land by inverting airborne gravity data and incorporating seismic, multibeam, and radar depth references. Our models reveal deep glacial troughs beneath the ice shelves and terminal moraines close to the continental shelf breaks, which currently limit the entry of Warm Deep Water from the Southern Ocean. The ice shelves buttress a catchment that comprises an ice volume equivalent to nearly 1 m of eustatic sea level rise, partly susceptible to ocean forcing. Changes in water temperature and thermocline depth may accelerate marine-based ice sheet drainage and constitute an underestimated contribution to future global sea level rise. Plain Language Summary The grounded ice sheets of Antarctica are stabilized by floating ice shelves. Any loss in ice shelf mass is matched by an increase in ice sheet drainage, which contributes to rising sea level. The ice shelves of western Dronning Maud Land are currently in balance with an inland ice volume that has the potential to raise global sea level by nearly 1 m. Ice shelves lose most of their mass from their bases when warm water intrudes from the surrounding ocean. The extent to which this occurs depends on the depth and shape of the seafloor beneath the ice shelves. We have modeled water depths beneath the ice shelves of Dronning Maud Land using airborne gravity data and depth measurements from seismic, multibeam, and radar data. Our bathymetric models show deep troughs beneath the ice shelves and shallow sills close to the continental shelf. These sills currently limit water mass exchange with Warm Deep Water from the Southern Ocean and so protect the ice shelves from significant melting at their bases. A changing climate with increasing ocean temperatures or a shallowing of warm water masses may increase ice shelf melting and lead to an increased sea level contribution.},

Here, we present a bathymetric model for the central Dronning Maud Land margin, based on a constrained inversion of airborne gravity data. It shows the cavities beneath the region's two ice shelves to be much deeper than in existing bathymetric compilations, but to be shielded from Warm Deep Water ingress and basal melting by the presence of shallow bathymetric sills along the continental shelf. Over areas of multi-year sea ice, the model returns bathymetric estimates of similar accuracy to gravity interpolation-based methods over open water. Airborne gravity thus presents an opportunity to bathymetrically map hundreds of thousands of square kilometres of the most inaccessible margins of Antarctica at resolutions adequate for regional and global oceanographic and glaciological modelling and interpretation.},

  abstract = {Over the past 60 years, scientists have strived to understand the past, present and future of the Antarctic Ice Sheet. One of the key components of this research has been the mapping of Antarctic bed topography and ice thickness parameters that are crucial for modelling ice flow and hence for predicting future ice loss and ensuing sea level rise. Supported by the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR), the Bedmap3 Action Group aims not only to produce new gridded maps of ice thickness and bed topography for the international scientific community, but also to standardize and make available all the geophysical survey data points used in producing the Bedmap gridded products. Here, we document the survey data used in the latest iteration, Bedmap3, incorporating and adding to all of the datasets previously used for Bedmap1 and Bedmap2, including ice-bed, surface and thickness point data from all Antarctic geophysical campaigns since the 1950s. More specifically, we describe the processes used to standardize and make these and future survey and gridded datasets accessible under the \&lsquo;Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable\&rsquo; (FAIR) data principles. With the goals to make the gridding process reproducible and to allow scientists to re-use the data freely for their own analysis, we introduce the new SCAR Bedmap Data Portal ({$<$}a href="bedmap.scar.org" target="\_blank" rel="noopener"{$>$}bedmap.scar.org{$<$}/a{$>$}, last access: 18 October 2022) created to provide unprecedented open access to these important datasets, through a user-friendly webmap interface.

An important part of this effort is revising procedures for calculating gravity anomalies, taking into account our enhanced computational power, improved terrain databases and datums, and increased interest in more accurately defining long-wavelength anomaly components. Users of the databases may note minor differences between previous and revised database values as a result of these procedures. Generally, the differences do not impact the interpretation of local anomalies but do improve regional anomaly studies. The most striking revision is the use of the internationally accepted terrestrial ellipsoid for the height datum of gravity stations rather than the conventionally used geoid or sea level. Principal facts of gravity observations and anomalies based on both revised and previous procedures together with germane metadata will be available on an interactive Web-based data system as well as from national agencies and data centers. The use of the revised procedures is encouraged for gravity data reduction because of the widespread use of the global positioning system in gravity fieldwork and the need for increased accuracy and precision of anomalies and consistency with North American and national databases. Anomalies based on the revised standards should be preceded by the adjective ``ellipsoidal'' to differentiate anomalies calculated using heights with respect to the ellipsoid from those based on conventional elevations referenced to the geoid.},

  abstract = {Abstract. The recent rapid growth of rifts in the Brunt Ice Shelf appears to signal the onset of its largest calving event since records began in 1915. The aim of this study is to determine whether this calving event will lead to a new steady state in which the Brunt Ice Shelf remains in contact with the bed, or an unpinning from the bed, which could predispose it to accelerated flow or possible break-up. We use a range of geophysical data to reconstruct the sea-floor bathymetry and ice shelf geometry, to examine past ice sheet configurations in the Brunt Basin, and to define the present-day geometry of the contact between the Brunt Ice Shelf and the bed. Results show that during past ice advances grounded ice streams likely converged in the Brunt Basin from the south and east. As the ice retreated, it was likely pinned on at least three former grounding lines marked by topographic highs, and transverse ridges on the flanks of the basin. These may have subsequently formed pinning points for developing ice shelves. The ice shelf geometry and bathymetry measurements show that the base of the Brunt Ice Shelf now only makes contact with one of these topographic highs. This contact is limited to an area of less than 1.3 to 3\,km2 and results in a compressive regime that helps to maintain the ice shelf's integrity. The maximum overlap between ice shelf draft and the bathymetric high is 2--25\,m and is contingent on the presence of incorporated iceberg keels, which protrude beneath the base of the ice shelf. The future of the ice shelf depends on whether the expected calving event causes full or partial loss of contact with the bed and whether the subsequent response causes re-grounding within a predictable period or a loss of structural integrity resulting from properties inherited at the grounding line.},

  abstract = {An efficient random sampling method is introduced to estimate the contributions of several sources of uncertainty to prediction variance of (computer) models. Prediction uncertainty is caused by uncertainty about the initial state, parameters, unknown (e.g. future) exogenous variables, noises, etcetera. Such uncertainties are modelled here as random inputs into a deterministic model, which translates input uncertainty into output uncertainty. The goal is to pinpoint the major causes of output uncertainty. The method presented is particularly suitable for cases where uncertainty is present in a large number of inputs (such as future weather conditions). The expected reduction of output variance is estimated for the case that various (groups of) inputs should become fully determined. The method can be applied if the input sources fall into stochastically independent groups. The approach is more flexible than conventional methods based on approximations of the model. An agronomic example illustrates the method. A deterministic model is used to advise farmers on control of brown rust in wheat. Empirical data were used to estimate the distributions of uncertain inputs. Analysis shows that effective improvement of the precision of the model's prediction requires alternative submodels describing pest population dynamics, rather than better determination of initial conditions and parameters.},

Five 35 d repeats of fast-delivery data, comprising approximately 100000 height estimates, have been used to produce a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) of the Ross Icc Shelf north of 81.5{$^\circ$} S. Careful filtering of the altimeter data, which removed about 30\% of the measurements, ensured that only valid values were used. The data were grldded to produce a DEM with a cell size of 10km. Repeatability of the data was assessed from an analysis of crossing points of ascending and descending tracks. The rms cross-over difference for the ice shelf was 0.94 m. Using the five repeat tracks gave a random error of 0.30 m for an averaged height measurement. Regionally correlated errors in the orbit and geoid add a systematic long wavelength bias of approximately 2m to the final elevation estimate. Two of the latest geoid models, OSU91-A and JGMI, were compared with the available in situ data and hYdrostatic models based on ice and water densities.The altimetry was compared with ice-thickness data from Ross Icc Shelf Geophysical and Glaciological Survey (RIGGS) stations and Scott Polar Research Institute radio-echo-sounding surveys undertaken in the 1970s. Differences between the DEM and heights calculated from ice thicknesses and a standard density -depth equation lie, in general, within the combined measurement errors. There are, however, several areas where this is not the case. Prominent north-south stripes of different ice thickness shown on a RIGGS map apparently do not exist. Low elevations are associated with high-density ice draining from East Antarctic outlet glaciers.

The depth of a decision tree, number of trees in a forest, number of hidden layers and neurons in each layer in a neural network, and degree of regularization to prevent overfitting are a few examples of quantities that must be prescribed for these algorithms. Not only do ideal settings for the hyperparameters dictate the performance of the training process, but more importantly they govern the quality of the resulting predictive models. Recent efforts to move from a manual or random adjustment of these parameters include rough grid search and intelligent numerical optimization strategies.},

This difference in purpose has led to some confusion among geophysicists, and this tutorial attempts to clarify two points of the confusion. First, it is well known now that gravity anomalies after the ``free-air'' correction are still located at their original positions. However, the ``free-air'' reduction was thought historically to relocate gravity from its observation position to the geoid (mean sea level). Such an understanding is a geodetic fiction, invalid and unacceptable in geophysics. Second, in gravity corrections and gravity anomalies, the elevation has been used routinely. The main reason is that, before the emergence and widespread use of the Global Positioning System (GPS), height above the geoid was the only height measurement we could make accurately (i.e., by leveling).},

Ice rises typically rise several hundreds of meters above the surrounding ice shelf; shelf flow is diverted around them. On the other hand, shelf ice flows across ice rumples, which typically rise only a few tens of meters above the ice shelf. Ice rises contain rich histories of deglaciation and climate that extend back over timescales ranging from a few millennia to beyond the last glacial maximum. Numerical model results have shown that the buttressing effects of ice rises and rumples are significant, but details of processes and how they evolve remain poorly understood. Fundamental information about the conditions and processes that cause transitions between floating ice shelves, ice rises and ice rumples is needed in order to assess their impact on ice-sheet behavior. Targeted high-resolution observational data are needed to evaluate and improve prognostic numerical models and parameterizations of the effects of small-scale pinning points on grounding-zone dynamics.},

  abstract = {Getz Ice Shelf, the largest producer of ice shelf meltwater in Antarctica, buttresses glaciers that hold enough ice to raise sea level by 22 cm. We present a new bathymetry of its sub-ice shelf cavity using a three-dimensional inversion of airborne gravity data constrained by multibeam bathymetry at sea and a reconstruction of the bedrock from mass conservation on land. The new bathymetry is deeper than previously estimated with differences exceeding 500 m in a number of regions. When incorporated into an ocean model, it yields a better description of the spatial distribution of ice shelf melt, specifically along glacier grounding lines. While the melt intensity is overestimated because of a positive bias in ocean thermal forcing, the study reveals the main pathways along which warm oceanic water enters the cavity and corroborates the observed rapid retreat of Berry Glacier along a deep channel with a retrograde bed slope. Plain Language Summary The Getz Ice Shelf is a major ice shelf in West Antarctica that is rapidly melting. Its exposure to warm oceanic water has made it the largest producer of ice shelf meltwater in Antarctica. To understand its evolution and the impact on sea level rise of the glaciers that flow into it, it is essential to obtain a better description of the bathymetry beneath its hundreds of meters of floating ice. We use a combination of airborne gravity and other data to infer the depth of the cavity. We find the seabed to be in several regions more than 500 m deeper than previously reported, hence revealing one of the deepest ice shelf cavities in West Antarctica. When used in combination with an ocean model, the bathymetry helps to better explain the spatial variability in melt observed from remote sensing data, the pathways for warm waters to reach the ice shelf, and the recent evolution of selected glaciers.},

  abstract = {Pine Island Glacier (PIG) in the Amundsen Sea sector of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) is losing mass and contributing to global sea-level rise at an accelerating rate. Although recent observations and modeling have identified the incursion of relatively warm Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW) beneath the PIG ice shelf (PIGIS) as the main driver of this ice-mass loss, the lack of precise bathymetry limits furthering our understanding of the ice--ocean interactions and improving the accuracy of modeling. Here we present updated bathymetry and sediment distribution beneath the PIGIS, modeled by the inversion of aerogravity data with constraints from active-source seismic data, observations from an autonomous underwater vehicle, and the regional gravity-anomaly field derived from satellite gravity observations. Modeled bathymetry shows a submarine ridge beneath the middle of PIGIS that rises {$\sim$}350 to 400 m above the surrounding sea floor, with a minimum water-column thickness of {$\sim$}200 m above it. This submarine ridge continues across the whole width of the 45-km wide ice shelf, with no deep troughs crossing it, confirming the general features of the previously predicted sub-ice-shelf ocean circulation. However, the relatively low resolution of the aerogravity data and limitations in our inversion method leave a possibility that there is an undetected, few-kilometerswide or narrower trough that may alter the predicted sub-ice-shelf ocean circulation. Modeled sediment distribution indicates a sedimentary basin of up to {$\sim$}800 m thick near the current grounding zone of the main PIG trunk and extending farther inland, and a region seaward of the submarine ridge where sediments are thin or absent with exposed crystalline basement that extends seaward into Pine Island Bay. Therefore, the submarine ridge marks the transition from a thick sedimentary basin providing a smooth interface over which ice could flow easily by sliding or sediment deformation, to a region with no to little sediments and instead a rough interface over which ice flows mainly by deformation. We hypothesize that the post-Last Glacial Maximum retreat of PIG stabilized at this location because of the spatial transition in basal conditions. This in turn supports the hypothesis that the recent retreat of PIG was strongly forced, probably by changes in ocean circulation, rather than occurring because of ongoing response to the end of the ice age or other changes inland of or beneath PIG.},

  abstract = {Developments in instrumentation, data collection, computer performance, and visualisation have been catalysts for significant advances in modelling and inversion of geophysical data. Forward modelling, which is fundamental to intuitive geological understanding and practical inversion methods, has progressed from representations using simple 3D models to whole earth models using voxels and discrete surfaces. Inversion has achieved widespread acceptance as a valid interpretation tool and major progress has been made by integrating geological models as constraints for both voxel and multi-body parametric methods. As a consequence, potential field, IP and electromagnetic inversion methods have become an essential part of most mineral exploration programs. In this paper we summarize some of the progress made over the last decade for each of these data types. Inversion applications are divided into three categories: (a) Type I (discrete body), (b) Type II (pure property) and (c) Type III (lithologic). Potential field inversions are the most advanced and thus most commonly used. 3D DC resistivity and IP inversions are becoming more prevalent. 3D EM inversions, in both time and frequency domains, are just emerging. Inversion examples are drawn from a number of groups and over different geological targets. However, we make extensive use of the geophysical data set from San Nicolas, since 3D inversions of all data types have been carried out there. The paper is essentially non-mathematical but we have incorporated some generic detail regarding how the inversions are carried out and the computations needed. We conclude the paper with our views of where research will be focused for the next decade and also provide our assessment of the challenges that the industry must address to make maximum use of inversion methodologies.},

  abstract = {The gravity anomaly is defined as the difference between the Earth's gravity on the geoid and the normal gravity on the reference ellipsoid. Because these quantities are not at the same point, the anomaly contains centrifugal accelerations and cannot be considered a harmonic function. The gravity disturbance is the difference between gravity and normal gravity at the same point. Consequently, the centrifugal effects can be neglected and the disturbance can be considered a harmonic function. This is the premise behind most potential-field data processing techniques (e.g., upward/downward continuation). Unlike the anomaly, the disturbance is due solely to the gravitational effects of geologic sources, making it the most appropriate for geophysical purposes. Use of the gravity anomaly in geophysics carries with it the implicit assumption that it is a good approximation for the gravity disturbance. However, bear in mind that the difference between the gravity disturbance and the free-air anomaly can be larger than 10 mGal worldwide. In fact, we argue that the assumptions made during gravity forward and inverse modeling imply that the quantity being modeled is the disturbance, not the anomaly.},

The software serves as both a user-ready toolbox that includes many of the latest methods for UQ in computational modeling and a convenient development environment for Python programmers advancing the field of UQ. The paper presents an introduction to the software's architecture and existing capabilities, divided in the code in a set of modules centered around different UQ tasks such as sampling methods, generation of random processes and random fields, probabilistic inverse modeling, reliability analysis, surrogate modeling, and active learning. The paper also highlights the importance of the RunModel module, which is used to drive simulations in the uncertainty analyses performed in UQpy. This module conveniently allows the user to define computational models directly in Python, or to run simulations from a third-party software in serial or in parallel. To illustrate the various capabilities, two examples are tracked throughout the paper and analyzed repeatedly for various UQ tasks. The first is a Python model solving a nonlinear structural dynamics problem, used to illustrate UQpy's capabilities in sampling and forward propagation of high dimensional random vectors (stochastic processes), and probabilistic inference. The second model is a third-party Abaqus finite element model solving the thermomechanical response of a beam structure. This example is used to illustrate UQpy's capabilities in variance reduction sampling techniques, reliability analysis, surrogate modeling and active learning techniques.},

In 2009--2017, the mass loss was dominated by the Amundsen/Bellingshausen Sea sectors, in West Antarctica (159  {\textpm} {\textpm}  8 Gt/y), Wilkes Land, in East Antarctica (51  {\textpm} {\textpm}  13 Gt/y), and West and Northeast Peninsula (42  {\textpm} {\textpm}  5 Gt/y). The contribution to sea-level rise from Antarctica averaged 3.6  {\textpm} {\textpm}  0.5 mm per decade with a cumulative 14.0  {\textpm} {\textpm}  2.0 mm since 1979, including 6.9  {\textpm} {\textpm}  0.6 mm from West Antarctica, 4.4  {\textpm} {\textpm}  0.9 mm from East Antarctica, and 2.5  {\textpm} {\textpm}  0.4 mm from the Peninsula (i.e., East Antarctica is a major participant in the mass loss). During the entire period, the mass loss concentrated in areas closest to warm, salty, subsurface, circumpolar deep water (CDW), that is, consistent with enhanced polar westerlies pushing CDW toward Antarctica to melt its floating ice shelves, destabilize the glaciers, and raise sea level.},

  abstract = {Many tasks in applied geosciences cannot be solved by single measurements, but require the integration of geophysical, geotechnical and hydrological methods. Numerical simulation techniques are essential both for planning and interpretation, as well as for the process understanding of modern geophysical methods. These trends encourage open, simple, and modern software architectures aiming at a uniform interface for interdisciplinary and flexible modelling and inversion approaches. We present pyGIMLi (Python Library for Inversion and Modelling in Geophysics), an open-source framework that provides tools for modelling and inversion of various geophysical but also hydrological methods. The modelling component supplies discretization management and the numerical basis for finite-element and finitevolume solvers in 1D, 2D and 3D on arbitrarily structured meshes. The generalized inversion framework solves the minimization problem with a Gauss-Newton algorithm for any physical forward operator and provides opportunities for uncertainty and resolution analyses. More general requirements, such as flexible regularization strategies, time-lapse processing and different sorts of coupling individual methods are provided independently of the actual methods used. The usage of pyGIMLi is first demonstrated by solving the steady-state heat equation, followed by a demonstration of more complex capabilities for the combination of different geophysical data sets. A fully coupled hydrogeophysical inversion of electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) data of a simulated tracer experiment is presented that allows to directly reconstruct the underlying hydraulic conductivity distribution of the aquifer. Another example demonstrates the improvement of jointly inverting ERT and ultrasonic data with respect to saturation by a new approach that incorporates petrophysical relations in the inversion. Potential applications of the presented framework are manifold and include time-lapse, constrained, joint, and coupled inversions of various geophysical and hydrological data sets.},

Subsequent iterations update the depth estimates toward the correct values, at the same time preserving the correct fault horizontal positions. Additionally, we stabilize each solution correction by the smoothness constraint without inverting any matrix. The method was substantially more efficient than the nonlinear method, which solves a system of linear equations by the conjugate gradient method at each iteration. For 3000 parameters, it is almost four times faster than the conjugate gradient, and this ratio increased with the number of parameters.},

There exist a variety of methods aimed at uncertainty estimation, which are often complicated and difficult to implement. We present an inversion technique that produces multiple solutions, based on bootstrap resampling, to create a qualitative uncertainty measure for 2-D magnetotelluric inversion models. The approach is easy to implement, can be used with almost any inversion code, and does not require access to the inversion software's source code. It is capable of detecting the effect of data uncertainties on the model result rather than just analysing the effect of model variations on the model response. To obtain uncertainty estimates for an inversion model, the original data set is resampled repeatedly and alternate data set realizations are created and inverted. This ensemble of solutions is then statistically analysed to determine the variability between the different solutions. The process yields interpretable uncertainty maps for the inversion model and we demonstrate its effectiveness to qualitatively quantify uncertainty in synthetic model tests and a case study.},

We present two techniques for reducing the computational cost of equivalent source processing: block-averaging source locations and the gradient-boosted equivalent source algorithm. Through block-averaging, we reduce the number of source coefficients that must be estimated while retaining the minimum desired resolution in the final processed data. With the gradient-boosting method, we estimate the sources coefficients in small batches along overlapping windows, allowing us to reduce the computer memory requirements arbitrarily to conform to the constraints of the available hardware. We show that the combination of block-averaging and gradient-boosted equivalent sources is capable of producing accurate interpolations through tests against synthetic data. Moreover, we demonstrate the feasibility of our method by gridding a gravity data set covering Australia with over 1.7 million observations using a modest personal computer.},

  abstract = {Petermann Glacier is a major glacier in northern Greenland, maintaining one of the few remaining floating ice tongues in Greenland. Monitoring programs, such as NASA's Operation IceBridge have surveyed Petermann Glacier over several decades and have found it to be stable in terms of mass balance, velocity and grounding-line position. The future vulnerability of this large glacier to changing ocean temperatures and climate depends on the ocean--ice interactions beneath its floating tongue. These cannot currently be predicted due to a lack of knowledge of the bathymetry underneath the ice tongue. Here we use aerogravity data from Operation IceBridge, together with airborne radar and laser data and shipborne bathymetry-soundings to model the bathymetry beneath the Petermann ice tongue. We find a basement-cored inner sill at 540--610 m depth that results in a water cavity with minimum thickness of 400 m about 25 km from the grounding line. The sill is coincident with the location of the melt rate minimum. Seaward of the sill the fjord is strongly asymmetric. The deepest point occurs on the eastern side of the fjord at 1150 m, 600 m deeper than on the western side. This asymmetry is due to a sedimentary deposit on the western side of the fjord. A 350--410 m-deep outer sill, also mapped by marine surveys, marks the seaward end of the fjord. This outer sill is aligned with the proposed Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) grounding-line position for Petermann Glacier. The inner sill likely provided a stable pinning point for the grounding line in the past, punctuating the retreat of Petermann Glacier since the LGM.},

  abstract = {Estimating the relief of the Moho from gravity data is a computationally intensive nonlinear inverse problem. What is more, the modelling must take the Earths curvature into account when the study area is of regional scale or greater. We present a regularized nonlinear gravity inversion method that has a low computational footprint and employs a spherical Earth approximation. To achieve this, we combine the highly efficient Bott's method with smoothness regularization and a discretization of the anomalous Moho into tesseroids (spherical prisms). The computational efficiency of our method is attained by harnessing the fact that all matrices involved are sparse. The inversion results are controlled by three hyperparameters: the regularization parameter, the anomalous Moho density-contrast, and the reference Moho depth. We estimate the regularization parameter using the method of hold-out cross-validation. Additionally, we estimate the density-contrast and the reference depth using knowledge of the Moho depth at certain points. We apply the proposed method to estimate the Moho depth for the South American continent using satellite gravity data and seismological data. The final Moho model is in accordance with previous gravity-derived models and seismological data. The misfit to the gravity and seismological data is worse in the Andes and best in oceanic areas, central Brazil and Patagonia, and along the Atlantic coast. Similarly to previous results, the model suggests a thinner crust of 30--35 km under the Andean foreland basins. Discrepancies with the seismological data are greatest in the Guyana Shield, the central Solimo{\texttildelow}es and Amazonas Basins, the Parana{\textasciiacute} Basin, and the Borborema province. These differences suggest the existence of crustal or mantle density anomalies that were unaccounted for during gravity data processing.},

  abstract = {The rigorous relation between the sought subsurface anomalous density distribution and the gravity anomaly, the gravity disturbance, and the geoidal height is newly reviewed. The emphasis is put on the proper treatment of the respective effects of topographical masses. The aim is to prove, that the rigorous formulation of the above mentioned relations calls for using such topographical corrections that adopt the reference ellipsoid as the lower boundary of the topography, and a reference topographical density. We base our derivations on a reference topographical density that is chosen to be globally constant. Such topographical corrections are then referred to as ``No Ellipsoidal Topography of Constant Density'' corrections, abbreviated as ``NETC'' corrections, as they differ from the commonly used Bouguer topographical corrections. We derive the NETC corrections to the disturbing potential, the gravity disturbance, the gravity anomaly, and the geoidal height. Equations are derived, that link the anomalous density, via Newton integrals with specific kernels, with the NETC gravity disturbance, the NETC gravity anomaly, and the NETC geoidal height. Prescriptions for compiling the NETC gravity disturbance, anomaly, and geoidal height from observable data are derived. It is proved, that the NETC gravity disturbance is rigorously equal to the gravitational effect (attraction) of the anomalous density distribution inside the entire earth. That is the fundamental point of the paper. The spherical complete Bouguer anomaly (SCBA) widely used in geophysical studies is then compared with the NETC gravity disturbance. The SCBA is also demonstrated to be a hybrid quantity, neither an anomaly, nor a disturbance. The systematic deviation between the SCBA and the NETC gravity disturbance is shown to be the most general form of the so called geophysical indirect effect (GIE), which is defined as the departure of the SCBA from the attraction of anomalous earth's masses. The GIE is computed for the area of the Eastern Alps.},

Each type produces a specific ``topo--corrected gravity disturbance'', referred to as ``NT'', ``NTC'', ``NET'', and ``NETC''. Our objective is to compare the four types and to study the physical meaning, in the light of gravity data interpretation/inversion, of these four gravity disturbances. Our method of investigation is the decomposition of the actual potential and actual gravity. It is shown, that the ``NETC gravity disturbance'' -- i.e. the gravity disturbance corrected for the gravitational effect of topographical masses of constant density with the topo--surface as the upper boundary and the reference ellipsoid as the lower boundary -- is rigorously and exactly equal to the gravitational effect of anomalous density inside the entire earth, i.e., below the topo--surface. The regions, where the four types of the topo--corrected gravity disturbance are harmonic, are studied also. Finally some attention is paid to areas over the globe, where geodetic (ellipsoidal) heights of the topo--surface are negative, with regard to the evaluation of the topo--correction and in the context of the gravimetric inverse problem. The strategy for the global evaluation of the ``NETC topo--correction'', or its evaluation in areas with negative ellipsoidal topography, is presented.},

  abstract = {Totten Glacier is a fast-moving East Antarctic outlet with the potential for significant future sea-level contributions. We deployed four autonomous phase-sensitive radars on its ice shelf to monitor ice-ocean interactions near its grounding zone and made active source seismic observations to constrain gravity-derived bathymetry models. We observe an asymmetry in basal melting with mean melt rates along the grounding zone differing by up to 20 m/a. Our new bathymetry model reveals that this melt rate asymmetry coincides with an asymmetry in water column thickness and that the low-melting ice-shelf portion is shielded from the main cavity circulation. A 2-year record yields year-to-year melt rate variability of 7--9 m/a with no seasonal cycle. Our results highlight the key role of bathymetry near grounding lines for accurate modeling of ice-shelf melt, and the importance of sustained multi-year monitoring, especially at ice-shelf cavities where the dominant melt rate drivers vary primarily inter-annually.},

  abstract = {The bathymetry under the Amery Ice Shelf steers the flow of ocean currents transporting ocean heat, and thus is a prerequisite for precise modeling of ice-ocean interactions. However, hampered by thick ice, direct observations of sub-ice-shelf bathymetry are rare, limiting our ability to quantify the evolution of this sector and its future contribution to global mean sea level rise. We estimated the bathymetry of this region from airborne gravity anomaly using simulated annealing. Unlike the current model which shows a comparatively flat seafloor beneath the calving front, our estimation results reveal a 255-m-deep shoal at the western side and a 1,050-m-deep trough at the eastern side, which are important topographic features controlling the ocean heat transport into the sub-ice cavity. The new model also reveals previously unknown depressions and sills that are critical to an improved modeling of the sub-ice-shelf ocean circulation and induced basal melting.},
